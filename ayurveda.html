            <h2>Development of Ayurveda (A brief history)</h2>
            <p>
             The history of medicine in India is not a history of uninterrupted development. The science and art of medicine existed from the vedic period and maintained a steady pace of progress during the early centuries of the Christian era. Thereafter, there was a decline in creative activity but revisions and commentaries of the earlier works continued to appear till about the 10th Century. The period from the 10th Century to the 16th Century there was a great lull till the appearance of Bhavaprakasha. There has been no major contribution to Ayurvedic literature after this new work.
            </p>
            <p>
             It should be remembered that Ayurveda is not the science of health. Healthful living, prevention of disease, personal and social hygiene all come under its ambit, and not merely the cure of diseases.
            </p>
            <p>
             The origins of Ayurveda stretch deep into antiquity. From 3300–1300 BCE; a Bronze Age civilization flourished in the Indus Valley in today’s Pakistan. Many of the foods and spices we associate with Ayurvedic cuisine, including rice, mung beans, urad dal, ginger, and turmeric, were already being cultivated in this ancient period. Later, the center of civilization shifted to the Ganges basin, where a people who called themselves the Arya or noble ones practiced a positive and life-affirming spirituality encapsulated in the Vedas. Composed between 500 and 1000 BCE in an ancient form of Sanskrit, the Vedas celebrate the elements of life, especially fire, wind, and water, as well as Mother Earth and the plants and animals who dwell upon her. Many herbs, some now unknown and some still used in Ayurveda to this day, were originally described in the Vedas.
            </p>
            <p>
             As the Vedic or Gangetic civilization entered into the Iron Age at around 600 BCE, a spirit of reason and awakening dawned across the known world, with Plato and Aristotle giving their teachings in Greece, the Hebrew prophets in the Middle East and the Buddha in Northern India. Indian methods of healing shook off age-old trappings of superstition and acquired a clarity, depth of reasoning, and profound philosophical basis that have characterized Ayurveda ever since. From this awakening of empiricism and reason, the texts of Ayurveda, specifically Charak Samhita and Sushrut Samhita, arose. After centuries of clarification and refinement, these texts assumed their current form during India’s Golden Age, under the Gupta Empire, 320 to 550 CE.

            <h3>A glimpse of Ayurveda – The forgotten history and principles of Indian traditional medicine</h3>
            <h4>Basic doctrine principles of Ayurveda</h4>
            <p>
             Ayurveda believes that the entire universe is composed of five elements: Vayu (Air), Jala (Water), Aakash (Space or ether), Prithvi (Earth) and Teja (Fire). These five elements (referred to as Pancha Mahabhoota in Ayurveda) are believed to form the three basic humors of human body in varying combinations. The three humors; Vata dosha, Pitta dosha and Kapha dosha are collectively called as “Tridoshas” and they control the basic physiological functions of the body along with five sub-doshas for each of the principal doshas. Ayurveda believes that the human body consists of Saptadhatus (seven tissues) Rasa (tissue fluids), Meda (fat and connective tissue), Rakta (blood), Asthi (bones), Majja (marrow), Mamsa (muscle), and Shukra (semen) and three Malas (waste products) of the body, viz. Purisha (faeces), Mutra (urine) and Sweda (sweat). Vata dosha maintains the cellular transport, electrolyte balance, elimination of waste products and its effect is increased by dryness. Pitta dosha regulates the body temperature, optic nerve coordination and hunger and thirst management. Heat conditions of the body aggravate Pitta. Kapha dosha is increased due to sweet and fatty food and it provides lubrication to the joints for proper functioning. The catabolism of the
             body is believed to be governed by Vata, metabolism by Pitta and anabolism by Kapha. For a healthy state of health, a balance between the three doshas and other factors should be maintained. Any imbalance between the three causes a state of illness or disease. In Ayurveda it is believed, that a perfect balance between the nature elements and the Tridoshas of the human body should be maintained for a healthy state of living by following the principles of divine wisdom.

                Ayurveda employs the “Pancha karma” method in its therapies. Pancha karma therapy applies various processes for the rejuvenation of the body, cleansing and enhancing longevity. The Pancha karma is composed of five karmas (actions) that are used for removal of toxins from the body tissues. They are the Virechan (purgation though use powders, pastes or decoction), Vaman (forced therapeutic emesis by use of some medicines), Basti (use of enemas prepared from medicated oils), Rakta moksha (detoxification of blood) and Nasya (administration of medicines like decoctions, oils and fumes through nasal route).
            </p>
            <p>
             Ayurveda has a rich history; however, there were certain drawbacks in the approaches toward it, which inhibited its growth like the western system of medicine. The active components of the herbal drugs prescribed were not known, and even today many drugs still need further exploration for their active constituent characterization and elucidation of the mechanism of action. Even after decades of applying advanced analytical techniques for drug analysis, herbal drugs still face some drawbacks. The administration of combinations of several drugs adds to the complexity of study of the activity of these medications. A merit of traditional medicine systems as discussed earlier is that, they consider every individual as the prime focus of treatment rather than the disease. But this factor also possesses a hurdle to the applicability of medications on a general population basis. Several issues like, the variation in the potency due to difference in species, absence of an integrated coding for every species used commonly in TSMs, varying geographical location of growth, and incorrect identification and adulteration of drugs, non-uniform quality control standards, differences in processing methods, direct an alarming need towards comparative study of drugs used in both these system of medicine.
