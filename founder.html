Being brought up in an Indian household under the guidance of her Mother and Grandmother, she developed a deep connection with herbs and the ayurvedic lifestyle by incorporating them in her day to day life as well as cooking. Her faith in the efficacy of Ayurveda also influenced her mothering style, and later in her pursuits of ayurvedic studies. 
               </p>

                Infusing her knowledge of the both worlds, Bawani uses moderation in wellness to help in her personal journey to physical changes, healing and growth knitted well with Ayurveda and the bio-sciences.

                Having founded her IP Consultancy and Ayurvedic education propagation, Mrs K.N. Bawani continues to serve her beliefs that wellness sciences, ancient healing sciences of ayurveda, and education are the basis of productive wellness and interactive longevity.
